# Breakout Game â€“ MATLAB

A simplified version of the classic Breakout game built in MATLAB as a personal project.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- Paddle and ball movement
- Collision detection with bricks and walls
- Score tracking
- Simple 2D graphics using MATLAB plotting

## ðŸ§  What I learned
This project helped me understand:
- Game logic and event handling
- Real-time graphics updates
- User input and basic animation in MATLAB

## ðŸš€ How to run
1. Open `breakout.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script.
3. Use the arrow keys (or defined controls) to move the paddle and break all bricks!
